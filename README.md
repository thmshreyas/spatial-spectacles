THREE.JS

This is a project based on Three.js which allows you to create and render 3D objects in your webp pages

Here I have used use 3 main aspects to make this 3d project 
1. Renderer- it renders the type of the 3d object that one wants in the website.
2. Camera- it is used to set field of view , aspect , how far and near should be our object.
3. Controls- this give the functionality of rotation where an user can freely rotate the 3d object however they want.
